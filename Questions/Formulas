If f(x) is continuous:
lim of x as x approaches c of f(x) = f(c)
if f(x) = p(x)/q(x) and p(x) and q(x) = 0 or p(x) and q(x) = infnity:
lim of x as x approaches c of f(x) = p'(x)/q'(x)

Intermediate value theorum
if f(x) is continuous on [a,b] and f(b)>f(a)
for any a<=c<=b f(x)=c exists on [a,b]

Average rate of change: ((f(b)-f(a))/(b-a))
difference quotient: lim as h approaches 0 of (f(x+h)-f(x))/h = lim as x approaches c of((f(x)-f(c))/(x-c)) = f'(x)
tangent line at (a,f(a)): y = f'(a)(x-a)+f(a)
normal line at (a,f(a)): y = -(x-a)/f'(a)

Mean value theorum
if f(x) is continuous on [a,b]
there is a vaule c between a and b, so that f'(c)=((f(b)-f(a))/(b-a))

x(t) = position
v(t)= x'(t) = velocity
a(t) = v'(t) = acceleration

critical values are where f'(c)=0
if f'(x) changes from positive to negative at c then c is a relative max
if f'(x) changes from positive to negative at c then c is a relative min

if f''(c)>0 then f(x) is concave up at c
if f''(c)<0 then f(x) is concave down at c

derivative of inverse
if g(x) is the inverse of f(x), then g'(x) = 1/f'(f^-1(x))

Integrals
if F'(x) = f(x)
then int from a to b of f(x) = F(b)-F(a)
int from a to a of f(x) = 0
int from a to b of f(x) + int from b to c of f(x) = int from a to c of f(x)
int from a to b of f(x) = - int from b to a of f(x) = 
int from -a to a of f(x) = 2(int from a to b of f(x)) when f(x) is an odd function
int from -a to a of f(x) = 0 when f(x) is an even function

Rieman sums
if [a,b] is divided into n segments, the width of each segemnt = dx = (b-a)/n
right rieman sum = (dx)(f(x₀)+f(x₁)+...f(xₙ₋₁))
left rieman sum = (dx)(f(x₀)+f(x₂)+...f(xₙ))
midpoint rieman sum = (dx)(f(x₁/₂)+f(x₃/₂)+...f(x₍₂ₙ₋₁₎/₂))
trapezoidal rieman sum = (1/2)(dx)(f(x₀)+2f(x₁)+2f(x₂)+...f(xₙ))

int from a to b of f(x) = lim as n approaches infinity of the sum of n intervals with width i=1 of f(cᵢ)dx

average value of a function
(1/(b-a))(int from a to b of f(x))
the derivative of int from a to x of f(t) = f(x)
the derivative of int from x to b of f(t) = -f(x)
